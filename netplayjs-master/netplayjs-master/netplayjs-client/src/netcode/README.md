# Implementations of Network Synchronization Algorithms

The files in this folder contain the core implementations of the network synchronization algorithms.
These algorithms should be implemented generically enough to be used in other projects and applications
that don't use the NetplayJS framework. Each algorithm has benefits and trade-offs, so there isn't a
one-size-fits-all approach.
